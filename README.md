> **An enterprise-grade microservices platform demonstrating Domain-Driven Design, event-driven architecture, and modern DevOps practices.**
> 
> *Built during Fontys University 6th semester (2021) as an educational project - achieved through extensive online research, architectural study, and dedicated coding - **before generative AI tools were available**.*

Kwetter is a Twitter-like social platform for posting kweets, following friends, and keeping up with trending topics. Built with .NET 5, it showcases production-ready microservices architecture with comprehensive testing, event sourcing, and polyglot persistence.

### 2.1 Messaging Patterns

The system uses RabbitMQ with:
- **Topic Exchanges**: Flexible routing of integration events
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Automatic handling of failed messages
- **Channel Pooling**: Optimized connection management
- **Event Sourcing**: EventStoreDB for complete audit trail

### 2.2 Data Distribution

**Polyglot Persistence Strategy:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Transactional data (UserService, KweetService, AuthorizationService, FollowService)
- **Neo4j**: Social graph queries for timelines (TimelineService)
- **Redis**: WebSocket connection state and caching (NotificationService)
- **EventStoreDB**: Domain events for all services

#### UserService, KweetService, AuthorizationService, FollowService

![Relational databases](/docs/diagrams/kwetter%20relational%20databases.png)

#### TimelineService (Neo4j Graph Database)

The TimelineService uses Neo4j for efficient graph queries, combining:
- User's own kweets
- Kweets from followed users
- Kweets where user is mentioned
